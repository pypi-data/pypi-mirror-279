## Quick start

Conda package manager is recommended. Create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n polyharmonics python==3.10
```

Activate conda environment

```bash
conda activate polyharmonics
```

Install the package

```bash
pip install polyharmonics
```

Then you can run the client using the following command:

```bash
polyharmonics --help
```

Or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run polyharmonics --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/ComicIvans/polyharmonics/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codestyle and type checks</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `ruff`.

```bash
make polish-codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make test && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
</details>

## üìà Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ComicIvans/polyharmonics/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |
| :-----------------------------------: | :---------------------: |
|       `enhancement`, `feature`        |       üöÄ Features       |
| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | üîß Fixes & Refactoring  |
|       `build`, `ci`, `testing`        | üì¶ Build System & CI/CD |
|              `breaking`               |   üí• Breaking Changes   |
|            `documentation`            |    üìù Documentation     |
|            `dependencies`             | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependencies updates |

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/ComicIvans/polyharmonics/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.
