[build-system]
# Minimum requirements for the build system to execute.
# This overrides the setup.py file (PEP518).
# It is easier to include numpy because of the build isolation (PEP517), even
# though it is optional. Otherwise the --no-build-isolation flag would be required.
# If you want to ignore numpy, remove it here and in setup.py (setup_requires)
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "Cython", "numpy"]  # PEP 508 specifications.
