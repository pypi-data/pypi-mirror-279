# easy_py

easy_py is a Python package designed to make your Python coding experience easier by providing shorthand versions of commonly used functions. With easy_py, you can save keystrokes and time when writing basic Python code.

## Installation

Install Short-Py using pip:

```bash
pip install Short-Py
```
Usage
To use Short-Py, simply import the package and call its functions like so:

```python

from Short-Py import p

# Instead of using print(), use p() for the same result
p('Hello, world!')
```

Here is a quick example that shows Short-Py in action:

```python
from Short-Py import *

# Print a simple string
p("I'm using Short-Py!")

# Print multiple expressions
p("The answer to 2 + 2 is:", add(2, 2))
Output:
```
```bash
I'm using Short-Py!
The answer to 2 + 2 is: 4
```
