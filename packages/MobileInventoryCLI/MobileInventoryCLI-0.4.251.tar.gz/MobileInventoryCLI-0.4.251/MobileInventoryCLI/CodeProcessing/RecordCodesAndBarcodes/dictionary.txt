It will then deduct any allocations scheduled prior to the next scheduled receipt (which may be several periods in the future). Subsequent periods without any scheduled receipts will have the same available to promise as the previous period. Subsequent periods with scheduled receipts will generally start with a fresh calculation, ignoringany remaining available to promise from previous periods. There are many variations on exactly how available to promise is calculated and it is also important to note that available to promise often works independently of allocation systems.

It is computed by dividing the shipment volume by the minimum density requirement.

It serves a twofold purpose: 1. Primarily, it is used by the U.S. Bureau of Census for the compilation of export statistics on United States foreign trade (for this reason an export declaration is required for practically all shipments from the United States to foreign countries and the United States possessions, except for mail shipments of small value, or for those of a non commercial character); 2. The declaration also serves as an export control document because it must be presented, together with the export license, to the United States Customs at the port of export. If the goods may be exported under general export license, this fact must be stated on the export declaration.

It is called extensible because it is not a fixed format like Hypertext Markup Language (a single, predefined markup language). Instead, XML is actually a metalanguage (a language for describing other languages) that allows individuals to customize markup languages for limitless different types of documents. XML can do this because it is written in Standard Generalized Markup Language, the international standard metalanguage for text markup systems.

Order fill compares the number of orders shipped complete to the total number of orders shipped. Other examples of fill rates would include dollar fill rate (comparing dollars shipped to dollars ordered), unit fill rate (comparing units shipped to units ordered). In fulfillment operations and some distribution operations where orders are generally shipped within 24 hours of receipt of order, fill rates reflect the ability to immediately ship from stock. In manufacturing operations and distribution operations that have lead-times for products, fill rates reflect the ability to ship to an agreed-to date. In these environments fill rate measurements are sometimes called On-Time-and-Complete (OTC) measurement. Tolerances are sometimes used in fill rate measurements to allow lines or orders that are not shipped complete but are within the tolerance to be considered as "shipped complete". The tolerances may be based on units, dollars, lines, or dates (shipped within certain tolerance of required date).
