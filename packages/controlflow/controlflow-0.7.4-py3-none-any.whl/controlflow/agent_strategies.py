            next turn at completing the tasks in the task graph. Take into account
            any descriptions, tasks, history, instructions, and tools. Focus on
            agents assigned to upstream dependencies or subtasks that need to be
            completed before their downstream/parents can be completed. An agent
            can only work on a task that it is assigned to.
