This package comes with some useful functions that makes your
work easy , Here the functions name with their functionality
---
1. The main aim of the function `add_list_index_element()` is to take a list of integers as input from the user,
compute the sum of the digits of each integer in the list, and then create a new list that contains these sums
---
2. The main aim of the `stack()` function is to implement a simple stack data structure with a fixed size limit
and provide interactive operations for pushing and popping elements. The function allows users to repeatedly
choose between pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element from the stack, or exiting the program.

- Determine whether a given number is prime.
- Inform the user whether the number is prime or not through printed messages.
---
7. The main aim of the 1even_and_odd()` function is to:
- Read a list of integers from the user.
- Separate the integers into two lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.
- Display the lists of even and odd numbers, or inform the user if no even or odd numbers were provided.
