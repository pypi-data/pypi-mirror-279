This package comes with some useful functions that makes your
work easy , Here the functions name with their functionality
---
1. The main aim of the function `add_list_index_element()` is to take a list of integers as input from the user,
compute the sum of the digits of each integer in the list, and then create a new list that contains these sums
---
2. The main aim of the `stack()` function is to implement a simple stack data structure with a fixed size limit
and provide interactive operations for pushing and popping elements. The function allows users to repeatedly
choose between pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element from the stack, or exiting the program.
---
3. The main aim of the `find_positive_and_negative()` function is to:
-   Read a list of integers from the user.
-   Separate the positive and negative numbers into two different lists.
-   Calculate the sum of the positive numbers and the sum of the negative numbers.
-   Display the original list, the lists of positive and negative numbers, and their respective sums
---
4. The main aim of the `factor_finder()` function is to:
- Find all the factors of a given integer.
- Print each factor.
- Calculate and print the sum of all these factors.
---
5. The main aim of the `count_vowel_and_spaces()` function is to:
- Count the number of vowels and spaces in a given input text.
- Identify and list all the vowels present in the text.
- Display the original text, the count and list of vowels, and the count of spaces.
---
6. The main aim of the `prime_finder()` function is to:
- Determine whether a given number is prime.
- Inform the user whether the number is prime or not through printed messages.
---
7. The main aim of the 1even_and_odd()` function is to:
- Read a list of integers from the user.
- Separate the integers into two lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.
- Display the lists of even and odd numbers, or inform the user if no even or odd numbers were provided.
---
8. The main aim of the `fibonacci_series()` function is to:
- Generate and print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series, where n is provided by the user
