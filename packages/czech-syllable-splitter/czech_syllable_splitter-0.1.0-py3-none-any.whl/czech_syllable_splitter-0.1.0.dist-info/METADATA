## Czech Syllable Splitter
Alogirthm for splitting Czech words into syllables.
Inspired by a syllable counting algorithm from David Lukeš counting the vowels.

With Klára Bendová we put together rules to expand the vowels into syllables,
empirically finding some common letter groups to stay intact.

This is not a perfect solution, but it is a good start for Czech language processing.
Measuring the accuracy of this algorithm is a to-do, as well as adding more rules if needed.
