class HallucinationEvaluator:
    """
    HallucinationEvaluator is a class that evaluates whether a machine learning model has hallucinated or not.

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    evaluator = HallucinationEvaluator(quantization=True)
    evaluator.warmup()
    data = [
        ['Based on the following <context>Walrus are the largest mammal</context> answer the question <query> What is the best PC?</query>', 'The best PC is the mac'],
        ['What is the color of an apple', "Apples are usually red or green"],
    ]
    response = evaluator.evaluate(data)
    # Output
    # {'hallucinated': 1, 'percentage_hallucinated': 50.0, 'truthful': 1}
    ```

    Example Usage with References:
    ```python
    references = [
        "The chicken crossed the road to get to the other side",
        "The apple mac has the best hardware",
        "The cat is hungry"
    ]
    queries = [
        "Why did the chicken cross the road?",
        "What computer has the best software?",
        "What pet does the context reference?"
    ]
    responses = [
        "To get to the other side", # Grounded answer
        "Apple mac",                # Deviated from the question (hardware vs software)
        "Cat"                       # Grounded answer
    ]
    data = list(zip(queries, responses, references))
    response = evaluator.evaluate(data)
    # Output
    # {'hallucinated': 1, 'truthful': 2, 'percentage_hallucinated': 33.33333333333333}
