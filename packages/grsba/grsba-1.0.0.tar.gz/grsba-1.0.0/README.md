Generalized RSBA (GRSBA)

The Generalized RSBA (GRSBA) algorithm introduces a flexible approach to the RSBA algorithm by allowing the exponent t to be a configurable parameter. This enhancement retains the robustness of the original RSBA while adding a layer of adaptability, making it even more suitable for diverse applications. Here's the detailed description and comparison:
Description of GRSBA
