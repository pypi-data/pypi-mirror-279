class Config:
    """
    Config file for the series opening recognizer.

    Attributes:
    RATE: int
        Audio sample rate.
    MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH_SEC: int
        Minimum length of the intro in seconds.
    MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH_BEATS: int
        Minimum length of the intro in beats.
    MAX_SEGMENT_LENGTH_SEC: int
        Maximum length of the intro in seconds.
    MAX_SEGMENT_LENGTH_BEATS: int
        Maximum length of the intro in beats.
    PRECISION_SECS: float
        Precision of the correlation in seconds.
    PRECISION_BEATS: int
        Precision of the correlation in beats.
    SERIES_WINDOW: int
        Number of sequential audio samples to be matched with each other.
        E.g. 5 means that the first sample will be matched with the next 5 samples.
    OFFSET_SEARCHER__SEQUENTIAL_SECS: int
        Number of sequential 'non-intro' seconds that signal the end of the intro.
        Intro is considered to be over if the number of sequential 'non-intro' beats is greater than this value.
    OFFSET_SEARCHER__SEQUENTIAL_INTERVALS: int
        Number of sequential 'non-intro' beats that signal the end of the intro.
    ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD: bool
        Threshold for adjusting the borders of the intro. If the beginning
        of the intro is closer to the beginning of the audio than this value,
        the beginning of the intro will be set to 0. If the end of the intro
        is closer to the end of the audio than this value, the end of the intro
        will be set to the end of the audio.
    ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD_SECS: float
        Threshold for adjusting the borders of the intro (see ADJUSTMENT_THRESHOLD).
    SAVE_INTERMEDIATE_RESULTS: bool
        Save the correlation results to 'correlations' and 'offsets' folders.
        Make sure to create the folder before running the app.
