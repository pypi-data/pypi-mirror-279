    "# Creating a Virgo Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virgo model in Finesse 3 uses two main katscript files: the common Virgo file which contains the main interferometer definition, and an additional katscript file which contains extra variables, dofs, and detectors used in the pre-tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create a Virgo model depending upon which input is provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default**: Providing no input parses the default files.\n",
    "2. **File**: if passing a file, only that file will be parsed. It is assumed to be a tuned file (with the locks). If providing only a modified common file, the additional katscript file can be parsed explicitly using the `parse_additional_katscript` flag.\n",
    "3. **Directory**: Passing a directory will parse all kat files within the directory."
