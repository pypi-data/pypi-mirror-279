        """Stop a mass action  # noqa: E501

        Describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API. You can stop a mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass action.  - If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is generated because no records have been processed.  - If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a blank value for unprocessed records.  Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are not rolled back.   # noqa: E501
        This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
        asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True

        :param bulk_key: String of 32 characters that identifies a mass action. You get the bulk-key after performing a mass action through the REST API.  (required)
        :type bulk_key: str
        :param accept_encoding: Include the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.   If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a `Content-Encoding` header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. 
        :type accept_encoding: str
        :param content_encoding: Include the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. 
        :type content_encoding: str
        :param authorization: The value is in the `Bearer {token}` format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling [Create an OAuth token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/createToken). 
        :type authorization: str
        :param zuora_track_id: A custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.  The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (`:`), semicolon (`;`), double quote (`\"`), and quote (`'`). 
        :type zuora_track_id: str
        :param zuora_entity_ids: An entity ID. If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. 
        :type zuora_entity_ids: str

        :type async_req: bool, optional
        :param _preload_content: if False, the ApiResponse.data will
                                 be set to none and raw_data will store the
                                 HTTP response body without reading/decoding.

        :type _return_http_data_only: bool, optional
        :param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                                 number provided, it will be total request
                                 timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                                 (connection, read) timeouts.
        :param _request_auth: set to override the auth_settings for an a single
                              request; this effectively ignores the authentication
                              in the spec for a single request.
        :type _request_auth: dict, optional
        :type _content_type: string, optional: force content-type for the request
        :return: Returns the result object.
                 If the method is called asynchronously,
                 returns the request thread.
