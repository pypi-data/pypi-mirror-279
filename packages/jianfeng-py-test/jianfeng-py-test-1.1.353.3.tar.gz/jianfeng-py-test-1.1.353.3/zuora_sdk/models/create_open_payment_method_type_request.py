If no entity UUID is provided, the custom payment method type is available to the global entity and all the sub entities in the tenant.  You can get the entity ID through the [Multi-entity: List entities](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/older-api/operation/Get_Entities/) API operation or the **Manage Entity Profile** administration setting in the UI. To convert the format of the entity ID to UUID, separate the entity ID string in five groups with hyphens, in the form `<8-characters>-<4-characters>-<4-characters>-<4-characters>-<12-characters>` for a total of 36 characters.  Note: After the custom payment method type is created, you can only update this field to be empty. ")

This field must be unique in a tenant.  This field is used along with the `tenantId` field by the system to construct and generate the API name of the custom payment method type in the following way:  `<internalName>__c_<tenantId>`  For example, if `internalName` is `AmazonPay`, and `tenantId` is `12368`, the API name of the custom payment method type will be `AmazonPay__c_12368`.
