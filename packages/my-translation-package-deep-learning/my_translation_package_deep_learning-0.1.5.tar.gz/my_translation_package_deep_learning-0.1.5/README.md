# My Translation Package

A package for sequence-to-sequence models with encoder-decoder architecture, designed for machine translation tasks. This package can be used for translating text from one language to another using an encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism.

## Overview

The `my_translation_package` provides a simple and flexible way to create and train encoder-decoder models with attention for machine translation. It supports preprocessing, tokenization, and evaluation of text data, making it easy to develop and deploy machine translation models for various language pairs.

## Features

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Implements an encoder-decoder model with LSTM layers.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Integrates attention mechanism to improve translation accuracy.
- **Flexible Preprocessing**: Supports customizable preprocessing functions for different languages.
- **Easy Tokenization**: Provides utilities for tokenizing and padding text data.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes functions for training and evaluating the model.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```sh
pip install my_translation_package
