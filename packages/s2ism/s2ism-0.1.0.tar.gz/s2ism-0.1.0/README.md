# s²ISM

This python package implements s²ISM (Super-resolution Sectioning Image Scanning Microscopy),
a computational technique to reconstruct images with enhanced resolution, optical sectioning, signal-to-noise ratio
and sampling from a conventional ISM dataset acquired by a laser scanning microscope equipped with a detector array.

The ISM dataset should be a numpy array in the format (x, y, time, channel), where the temporal dimension is not mandatory
and the channel dimension is the flattened 2D dimension of the detector array.

This package also contains a module for simulating instrument-specific PSFs by retrieving the 
relavant parameters automatically from the raw dataset using a minimization procedure.
**Important**: the current implementation of the automatic PSF generation 
works under the assumption that the detectors of the array are arranged in a squared fashion.
If this is not the case for your detector (e.g. AiryScan), you need to provide the PSFs manually.
