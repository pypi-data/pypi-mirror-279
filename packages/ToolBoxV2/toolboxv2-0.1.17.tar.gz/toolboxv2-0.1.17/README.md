Application center *toolbox* for simple functions through to finished applications.

## Goal
The primary goal of the toolbox is to execute applications, integrate them, and make them system-independent.
The underlying system, built on a monolithic modular architecture, combines the advantages of both approaches,
enabling intuitive interaction with the digital world. It connects various components and provides utility functions accessible from anywhere.
Automatic error corrections are performed within a defined framework if necessary to ensure successful execution.
This platform promotes creative collaboration and eases access to digital resources.
