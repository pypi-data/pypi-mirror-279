        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
             for the public:

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time

             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                       NonCommercial purposes only.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
                  purposes.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.

                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
             only;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with

# DIAL
DIAL is a framework for simulating and visualizing distributed algorithms in Python.

![Screenshot of the DIAL visualization](https://github.com/DasenB/DIAL/blob/media/Readme-Images/screenshot_24_01_21.png?raw=true)


## Installation

You can use either `pip` or `nix` to install DIAL.
Python 3.12 is recommended and the only version that has been tested.

To run the simulator you need a `.py` file in which you import the DIAL package. Examples for this file are provided in the [examples directory](https://github.com/DasenB/DIAL/tree/main/examples).


```python
from DIAL import *
```


### Installation using PIP

```bash
pip install dial-simulator
```

Now you can run your `.py`-file.

```bash
python <PATH_TO_YOUR_PYTHON_FILE>
```

### Installation using Nix
The following command automaticly uses the correct version of python with all dependencies installed.
It does not make permanent changes to your system or your default python installation.

```
nix run github:DasenB/DIAL#python <PATH_TO_YOUR_PYTHON_FILE>
```

For this to work you need the [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download/) with enabled support for flakes.
To temporarily enable flakes you can add the flag `--experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` to the command.

Using the nix package manager you get the **exact** version of all dependencies that are specified in the repository. 
The result is a "works on all machines installation" similar to docker. 
If the installation using `pip` fails the `nix` approach probably still works.


### Installation using Docker

```
docker build --tag "dial" https://github.com/DasenB/DIAL.git#main
docker run --network host -v ~/:/dial -it dial
```

After doing this you receive a shell within a container that has the DIAL framework installed and your home-directory mounted.
From there you can run your `.py`-file.

```bash
python <PATH_TO_YOUR_PYTHON_FILE>
```

Now you must navigate to `https://localhost:10101/index.html` in your browser.


## Minimal Example

```python
# 1. Import the DIAL framework
from DIAL import *

# 2. Implement some algorithm
def hello_world_algorithm(state: State, message: Message) -> None:
  state.color = DefaultColors.RED

# 3. Create an initial message
initial_message = Message(
  source_address="A/hello_world/example_instance_asdf",
  target_address="B/hello_world/example_instance_asdf",
)

# 4. Create the simulator
simulator = Simulator(
  topology=DefaultTopologies.EXAMPLE_NETWORK_3,
  algorithms={
    "hello_world": hello_world_algorithm,
  },
  initial_messages={
    1: [initial_message]
  }
)

# 5. Run the simulator
api = API(simulator=simulator)
```


## Concepts

### 1. Distributed Algorithm
Any function with a signature of 
`(state: State, message: Message) -> None`
can be used as an algorithm. It must be passed to the simulator on initialisation.

Because the behaviour of the simulator should be deterministic, there are some restrictions on what you can do within
an algorithm-function.
To prevent you from accidentally breaking the determinism, access to objects defined outside the algorithm
is not possible.
Only the following objects defined outside your algorithm can be accessed:

| Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``Python Builtins``       | print, range, min, max, dict, ...                                                                                                                                            |
| ``DIAL.Address``          | A reference to an instance of an algorithm on a node                                                                                                                         |
| ``DIAL.Color``            | Representation of colors in RGB                                                                                                                                              |
| ``DIAL.DefaultColors``    | Enum with predefined colors                                                                                                                                                  |
| ``DIAL.Message``          | Object to communicate between different instances                                                                                                                            |
| ``DIAL.State``            | A State-object acts as the scope of an instance and is the only place where data persists between executions                                                                 |
| ``DIAL.send``             | Function to send messages between nodes that are directly connected within the topology                                                                                      |
| ``DIAL.send_to_self``     | Function to send messages that will be received on the same node after a specified delay                                                                                     |
| ``DIAL.get_local_states`` | Function that gives you a read-only copy of all instance states that are stored on the same local node. You should not try to change it as modifications are not persistent. |
| ``DIAL.get_global_time``  | Function that gives you the global simulation time                                                                                                                           |

**Note:** This also mean that you can not use any function provided by libraries like numpy. If you really need to use a library
you can import it directly within your algorithm function. But do so at your own risk!

Any algorithm-function receives the following two arguments: 

| Argument                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``state: State``                             | The state of the instance that is called. You can make changes to the values. They will persist between multiple function calls of the same instance.                                       |
| ``message: Message``                         | The message that is being received in the current processing step.                                                                                                                          |


### 2. Topology
A topology-object defines the system your algorithm is running on. It consists of nodes and edges.
The nodes receive, process and send messages and store an internal state. The edges transport messages between nodes.
Nodes are identified by their name, edges by their source and target node.

Edges have some properties that can be different for each individual edge. This way different behaviours can be simulated. 
The following properties are defined by an edges ``EdgeConfig``-object:

- ``direction``: unidirectional or bidirectional 
- ``reliability``: Probability with wich a message arrives at its target. This can be used to simulate loss of messages.
- ``scheduler``: Function that determines the arrival time for a message send through the edge. There are predefined scheduler-functions, but you also can implement your own.


### 3. Address
An address consists of three elements:

- **Node**:       Name of a processing unit that is part of the topology.
- **Algorithm**:  Dictionary-key of the algorithm function that is provided when creating the simulator.
- **Instance**:   An algorithm can be started multiple times. Each instance has a unique name that can be chosen arbitrarily.

Addresses are represented by ``DIAL.Address``-objects and can be formatted as a string in the following way: ``node/algorithm/instance``


### 4. Message
Messages are send between instances. The target-node and the target-algorithm must already exist. If the target-instance does not yet exist it is
created once the message is being received.

Every message has a color and a title which both can be seen in the frontend.
If no color is explicitly specified it defaults to white. The title is a string that can be freely chosen.
Arbitrary data can be placed in the messages data-attribute. To prevent object references from causing side effects across different nodes and to be able
to display the message as string in the frontend, all values stored in a message must be serializable to JSON. If you store objects in a message
you might need to implement your own json encoding and decoding. Also, object-references are deliberately broken up by replacing a send message with a deepcopy before it is being delivered.
Keep that in mind when putting objects into messages.

You can send messages within your algorithm using two different methods:

- `send(message)`: Can send messages between nodes that are connected through an edge. The arrival time of the message is determined by the edge of the topology.
- `send_to_self(message, delay)`: Can send messages to instances that are located on the same node. The delay until the message is received can be chosen.


### 5. Simulator and Frontend
The simulator-object is initialized with some a topology, a set of algorithms and a set of initial messages.
You can make the simulator execute steps by either calling ``simulator.step_forward()`` from your code or by
starting the api-frontend with the simulator (which is the recommended method).

When the api is started a browser window should be opened with the url ``https://127.0.0.1:10101/index.html``.
If that is not the case you can open it manually. In the frontend you can manipulate the state of the simulation by stepping forward or backward
and by changing messages and instance-states. The only browser that has been tested is Firefox. Other browsers might or might not work.

### 6. Randomness and Determinism
Distributed systems are inherently non-deterministic. This is one of the main reasons why creating distributed programs is so hard.
To aid in the development of such programs it is desirable to enable deterministic behaviour of the simulator.
In DIAL there are two mechanisms that control two different aspects of this:

#### 6.1 Determinism of Algorithm Functions
The first is the ability to step through the program execution step by step in both forward and backward directions.
Every processing step receives a state as input and produces an altered state as output. The sequence of states for 
every algorithm instance is being recorded. When stepping forward though the simulation new states are produced and added to the 
record. When going a step backwards the latest state is removed from the record and the previous state is outputted. 
To ensure that the next time a forward-step is taken it produces the same output that was previously removed the individual calls
to the algorithm function have to be deterministic.

DIAL archives this by limiting what can be done within an algorithm function. To make sure the output of an algorithm function
only depends on the arguments supplied to the function access to the global scope is prevented. You can not access any variables declared
outside your function. This includes imported libraries. If you need to use a library you can import it directly within your function.
BUT: This can lead to unintended side effects which might break the deterministic behaviour of the simulation.

For some algorithms access to random numbers is necessary. In this case the random numbers must be obtained through the simulator
and not for example by importing the ``random``-module. The following code shows how you can get a random number within an algorithm function.
The ``state.random_number_generator``-object is a [NumPy Random Generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html)-Object
which is provided by the simulator and you can use its functions.

```python
def algorithm(state: State, message: Message) -> None:
    x = int(state.random_number_generator.integers(low=0, high=10000))
```

#### 6.2 Determinism of Simulator Executions
The second desired property is the ability to reproduce behaviour across multiple executions of the python-script.
This can help when debugging and also enables the sharing of examples which always execute the same way.
For this reason the simulator can take a seed as argument. It defaults to 0 if you do not manually set it.

```python
simulator = Simulator(
    topology=...,
    algorithms=...,
    initial_messages=...,
    seed=0
)
```

There might be times when you want to test different execution paths of your program. This can be done by setting supplying ``None`` as a seed
to the Simulator. Now every time the python script is run a new seed is used. The ability to step forward and backward through the 
simulation as described in the previous section is still given.
