# Projet-PyAdverseSearch

## Description
This project aims to develop a Python library dedicated to adversarial exploration algorithms. The main goal is to provide users with a flexible and extensible platform for creating, simulating, and analyzing strategies in incomplete information game environments.

## Features
Implementation of adversarial exploration algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
Support for classic games like Connect Four and Tic-Tac-Toe.
Simple interface for extending and creating new games and algorithms.
Simulation and analysis of artificial intelligence strategies.

## Installation
