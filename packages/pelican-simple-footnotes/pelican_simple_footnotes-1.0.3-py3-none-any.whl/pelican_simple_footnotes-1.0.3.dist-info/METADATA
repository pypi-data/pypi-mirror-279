Simple Footnotes is a Pelican plugin for adding footnotes to articles and pages.

Installation
------------

This plugin, and its dependent package `html5lib`, can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-simple-footnotes

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `simple_footnotes` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

Usage
-----

When writing an article or page, add a footnote like this:

    Here’s my written text[ref]and here is a footnote[/ref].

This will appear as, roughly:

Here is my written text<sup>1</sup>

 1. and here is a footnote ↩&#xFE0E;

This should work with any content format (Markdown, reStructuredText, et cetera), because the plugin looks for `[ref]` and `[/ref]` once the conversion to HTML has happened.
