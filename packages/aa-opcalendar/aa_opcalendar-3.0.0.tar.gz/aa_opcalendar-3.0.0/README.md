## Setup
Before you are able to create new events on the front end you will need to setup the needed categories and visibility filters for your events.

### 1. Host
Hosts are for identifying reasons. If you run a single corporation or alliance entity you most likely only want one host. If you want to extend the calendar with other hosts such as NPSI communities you can create a host for each different entity.
- Host name is shown on the event and on discord notifications
- You can customize host logos
- Go to the admin site

### 2. Visibility filter
These filters will determine who is able to see the events that are labeled with each different visibility filter.
- Can be restricted to groups and states
- If no groups or states are selected the events will be visible for everyone
- You can determine a custom color tag that will be shown on the top right corner of the event
- Each visibility filter will be displayed on the calendar and can be used for filtering events on the calendar
- Discord notification webhooks can be assigned for each visibility filter. Events created, deleted or edited under this filter will then be sent over to discord.

### 3. Categories
Categories are displayed as a ticker infront of manually created events. Most common categories are: PvP, Stratop, Mining, CTA etc...
- Ticker displayed on event
- Custom colors

### 4. Discord webhook
If you want to receive notifications about your events (created/modified/deleted) on your discord you can add a webhook for the channel in discord you want to receive the notifications to. The webhooks you create will be used in the visibility filters.

## Adding manual events
To add a manual event simply go to the calendar page and press on the new event button. Fill in and select the needed information.


## Importing NPSI fleets
Opcalendar has  the ability to import predetermined NPSI fleets directly into your calendar from public NPSI community APIs.

### Supported NPSI communities
Opcalendar is currently supporting imports for the following NPSI fleets:

- EVE LinkNet
- Spectre Fleet
- EVE University (classes)
- Fun Inc.
- FRIDAY YARRRR
- Redemption Road
- CAS
- Fwaming Dwagons
- FREE RANGE CHIKUNS

### Setup

- **Go to admin panel and select NPSI Event Imports**
- **Create a host** for each import and fill in the needed details for them.
- **Add a new import** by pressing on the add event import button
- **Select the source** where you want to fetch the fleets.
- **Determine operation type** for each fetched fleet.
- **Determine operation visibility** for each fetched fleet.

To schedule the import runs either add the following line in your local.py file or set up a perioduc task for the `opcalendar.tasks.import_all_npsi_fleets` task on your admin menu to fetch fleets every hour.

```
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['import_all_npsi_fleets'] = {
    'task': 'opcalendar.tasks.import_all_npsi_fleets',
    'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*'),
}

```

## Importing fleets from ingame calendar
You can import events that have been created in the ingame calendar. As the fields on the ingame calendar are limited the events will not be as detailed as when created directly from the calendar.

1. Give the `add_ingame_calendar_owner` role for the wanter groups
2. Navigate to the opcalendar page and press the `Add Ingame Calendar Feed` button
3. Log in with the character that holds the calendar
5. Add the following line into your local.py setting file or set up a periodic task for the `opcalendar.tasks.update_all_ingame_events` to pull fleets from ingame every 5 minutes.

```
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE['update_all_ingame_events'] = {
    'task': 'opcalendar.tasks.update_all_ingame_events',
    'schedule': crontab(minute='*/5'),
}
```

### Ingame event visibility and categories
On default the ingame events you import have no visibility filter and no category. This means they **will be visible for everyone**.

If you wish to add a visibility filter or a category similar to the manual events simply go to the `admin panel -> Ingame event owners` and select a filter and a category for the owner.

After selecing a visibility filter and a category the ingame events will behave similar to the manual events and respect the group and state restrictions set for the visibility filters.

### Ical feed setup (optional)
Opcalendar has the ability to generate a standard ical formated feed for pushing out events. To push out evets to the feed without login requirement requires editing auth settings file.

#### Feed setup
1. Open up the event visibility category and check the box to include it in the ical feed. Only categories tagged with this box will show up on the feed.

2. Add 'opcalendar' to the local settings file settings.py in the APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS or create the section if you do not have it:

```
APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS = [
    'opcalendar',
]
```

3. You can now access the ical feed at `auth.example.com/opcalendar/feed.ics`
