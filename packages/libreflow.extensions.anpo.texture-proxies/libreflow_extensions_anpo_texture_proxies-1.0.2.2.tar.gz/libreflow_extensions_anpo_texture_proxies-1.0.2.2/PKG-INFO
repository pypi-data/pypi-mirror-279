## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2.2] - 2024-06-18

### Changed

* The maximum texture width is retrieved using the Blender API (already required for resizing), so it no longer depends on Image Magick's `identify`.

## [1.0.2.1] - 2024-05-31

### Fixed

* The `create_proxies` folder action dialog was immediately closing if the revision wasn't explicitly selected the first time the dialog was displayed.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-05-28

### Added

* A new action to create textures proxies for the latest textures of all assets of an asset type.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-05-28

### Added

* An option to overwrite existing proxies (disabled by default).
* A new action to create textures proxies for the latest textures of all assets of an asset family.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-27

### Added

* Action to create 1K and 2K versions of the images in a `textures` folder. The generated proxies are placed respectively in the `textures_1k` and `textures_2k` folders (when the target size does not exceed the original one).
