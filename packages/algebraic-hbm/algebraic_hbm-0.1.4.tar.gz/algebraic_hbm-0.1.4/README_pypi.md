# Algebraic Harmonic Balance Method

This package provides a Python implementation of the algebraic harmonic balance method (algebraic HBM) as proposed  by [[1](#reference-1)].

## Installation

The following command installs ```algebraic_hbm``` from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/.../). You will need a working installation of ```Python>=3.10``` and ```pip```.

```sh
pip install algebraic-hbm
```
