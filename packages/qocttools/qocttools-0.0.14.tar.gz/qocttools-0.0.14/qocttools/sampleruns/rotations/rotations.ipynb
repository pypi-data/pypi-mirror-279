    "The purpose of this same notebook is to demonstrate the use of monochromatic pulses to create unitaries, when these are docomponsed into sequences of rotations between levels. We will use some functions in the pulses module that create the pulses that induce sequences of rotations. Then, we will use the solvers module to propagate the system and demonstrate how the pulses work (approximately). To clarify evertyhing, we quickly summarize here some theoretical results."
