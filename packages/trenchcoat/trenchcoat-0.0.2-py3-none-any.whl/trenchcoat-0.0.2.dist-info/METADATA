# Trenchcoat

This is a super simple package, created following the [packaging projects tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

It just contains a function to add 1 to an input number.

The objective of this package is to be used in security research, trying to create situations where it is added to projects unbeknownst to their developers.
