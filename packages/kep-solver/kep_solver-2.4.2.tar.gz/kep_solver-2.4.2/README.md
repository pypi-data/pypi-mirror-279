# kep\_solver

This Python package is devoted to various algorithms, procedures and mechanisms
that are useful when studying kidney exchange programmes in general.  It is
written and maintained by [William Pettersson](mailto:william.pettersson@glasgow.ac.uk).

## Requirements

kep\_solver runs on Python 3.9 or higher. As long as you install via pip, all
other requirements will be handled by pip

## Quick start with notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/wpettersson%2Fkep_solver/HEAD)

This package provides two sample notebooks in the `notebooks` folder. You can
access either of these using [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/wpettersson%2Fkep_solver/HEAD).

Please note that MyBinder, as a free service, does have limits on its use. For
more intensive use, or where the privacy of the data you use is important, you
can self-install using the following instructions.

## Quick start self-install

Create a virtual environment for kep\_solver

    mkvirtualenv kep_solver

Install kep\_solver

    pip install kep_solver

Download a sample JSON file from
`https://kep-web.optimalmatching.com/static/jsons/sample-1.json`

Run the following Python commands

```python
# Import the required functions
from kep_solver.fileio import read_json
from kep_solver.pool import Pool
from kep_solver.model import TransplantCount

# Read some input
instance = read_json("sample-1.json")

# Create a transplant pool with one objective.
# We will allow cycles to have at most 3 donor/recipient pairs and allow chains
# to have have at most 2 donors (i.e., one non-directed donor and one
# donor/recipient pair).
pool = Pool([TransplantCount()],
            description="My first KEP Pool",
            maxCycleLength=3,
            maxChainLength=2)

# Solve our instance
solution, model = pool.solve_single(instance)

# Print the solution
for selected in solution.selected:
    print(f"Selected {selected}")
```

## Current features

* Reading instance files (json and XML formats)
* Creation of compatibility graphs
* Solving for the following objectives (single, or hierarchical)

    * Maximise the number of transplants
    * Maximise the number of backarcs
    * Maximise the number of effective 2-way exchanges
    * Minimise the number of three-cycles
    * Maximise the score using the UK scoring mechanisms

While the above objectives are exactly those in use by NHSBT when running the UKLKSS (the UK national KEP), I do intend to add further objectives

## Expected users

I see two classes of users of this software:

* Researchers - Depending on what questions you want answered, you can either test policy changes to determine how they affect the running of a KEP, or you can implement new models or objectives to see how they perform
* Health care institutes - I have tried to make this software as robust as possible, but for now I cannot guarantee any particular level of performance or any exact optimality of a solution. If you do want to use this software for real-world impact, feel free to get in touch and I may be able to help.

## Documentation

Full documentation for kep\_solver can be found at
[https://kep-solver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://kep-solver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Interface

This is just a Python module for now, a web-interface that demonstrates a basic
use case is viewable at
[https://kep-web.optimalmatching.com](https://kep-web.optimalmatching.com), and
the source code for said website is online at
[https://gitlab.com/wpettersson/kep\_web](https://gitlab.com/wpettersson/kep_web)

## Future plans

* More objective functions
* Random instance generation
* Simulating the development of a KEP over time
* Supporting transnational pools
* Implementation of faster models and modelling techniques
