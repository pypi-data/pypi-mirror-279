How to use:

This example shows how to use vardll 1.4.2:

"from vardll import DLLvar, load_file"

# Load the DLL file
dll_path = 'varotp.dll'
dll_variable = load_file(dll_path)

# Access the variables from the DLL file
print(dll_variable)

Make sure you have the vardll in the directory, like this:

test/
|
|__vardll
|     |
|     |__ __init__.py
|     |__ dllvariable.py
|     |__ license
|     |__ readme.md
|     |__ loader.py
|
|__main.py
|__var0otp.dll

Make sure in var0otp or any dll file you have your variable or the text you wanna input! Disclaimer:

IF THE DLL FILE STAYS EMPTY IT MIGHT MESS UP THE LIBRARY'S CODE!!

UPDATE: The file can any format, .exe or .png or .fc .lib or .dll, but it should not have real content, it should have content like the version of
your app etc.. not like binary code in a .exe and you wanna see it..

UPDATE 2: Make sure in your DLL file or .exe FILE or any other format it should have ==, example:
var0otp.dll:

version == 1.5.2
api = io.yrapi.com
