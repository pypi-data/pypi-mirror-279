Notes:						This file contains information about the boundary conditions of the material "mat_MDF12mm_plane"
							All relevant values are given in separate files in the csv-format
							
							Medium-density fibreboard with a thickness of 12mm. This material was used in for the construction of the diffusor in scene01.
							This data can be used to describe the diffusor if a simulation numerical model is applied. Geometrical models should use
							the material "mat_MDF12mm_structured" for the calculation of scene01
