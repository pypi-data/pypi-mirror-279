Notes:						This file contains information about the boundary conditions of the material "mat_MDF12mm_structured"
							All relevant values are given in separate files in the csv-format
							
							Medium-density fibreboard with a thickness of 12mm. This material was used in for the construction of the diffusor in scene01.
							Geometrical models should use this material for the calculation of scene01. Scattering coefficients are not provided, the
							participant is asked to define scattering coefficients according to the dimensions of the material. A more detailed description
							of the diffusor can be found in the scene description of scene01.


## Material information:

Scenes:						01
Origin of data: 			Measured (semianechoic chamber) between ~300 Hz - 20 kHz, estimated/extrapolated for lower frequencies 
Angle of incidence:			30°, 45°, 60°, (45° in + 32° out) 		// [ 0°  = normal incidence; 90° = grazing incidence]
Frequency Range:			20 Hz - 20 kHz (31 third octave values, see line 1 in csv file)	

Absorption coefficients:	[x] (see line 2 in csv file)
Scattering coefficients: 	[ ] (calculated/defined by participant!)
Impedance values:			[ ]
