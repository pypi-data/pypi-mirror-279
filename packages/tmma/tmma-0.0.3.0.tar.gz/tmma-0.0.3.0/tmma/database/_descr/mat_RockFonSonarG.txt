Notes:						This file contains information about the boundary conditions of the material "mat_RockFonSonarG"
							All relevant values are given in separate files in the csv-format
							
							The data which is valid for an infinte surface of absorber sheets (w=600 mm, l=600mm, h=20mm).
							Edge effects (due to limited distances in scene01 and scene02) have to be modelled or neglected by participants
							Material was provided by the company RockFon (ROCKWOOL)
							Product details can be found here: http://rwiumbraco-rfn.inforce.dk/media/3231070/de-rockfon-sonar.pdf

Origin of data: 			Measured (semianechoic chamber) between 60 Hz - 20 kHz, estimated/extrapolated for lower frequencies 
Angle of incidence:			30°, 45°, 60° // [ 0°  = normal incidence, 90° = grazing incidence]
Frequency Range:			20 Hz - 20 kHz (31 third octave values, see line 1 in csv file)
