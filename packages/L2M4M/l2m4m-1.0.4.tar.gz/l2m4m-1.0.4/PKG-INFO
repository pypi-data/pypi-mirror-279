# L2M4M

L2M4M (_LaTeX2MathML4Markdown_) is a Python package that extends the 
functionality of [Markdown][md] to support LaTeX math expressions by converting 
them to MathML, using [Latex2MathML][l2m]. This package is particularly 
useful for those who want to include mathematical notation in their Markdown 
documents without relying on external JavaScript libraries.

## Installation

To install L2M4M, use pip:

```bash
pip install L2M4M
```

## Usage

```python
import markdown
from l2m4m import LaTeX2MathMLExtension

# Sample Markdown text with LaTeX
text = """
Here is an inline math equation: $E = mc^2$.

Here is a block math equation:

$$ 
\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x
$$

And here is an alternative notation for a block math equation:

\[
x^n + y^n = z^n
\]
"""

# Convert the Markdown text to HTML with LaTeX2MathMLExtension
html = markdown.markdown(text, extensions=[
    LaTeX2MathMLExtension()
])

print(html)
```
