**When should I use iBridges instead of python-irodsclient/iCommands?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The python-irodsclient and the iCommands are much more powerful and expressive than iBridges. If you are already
intimately familiar with either of them, you probably don't need iBridges, since it doesn't add any functionality that isn't
already there.

The target audience of iBridges is different: it tries to help researchers/users that are not
expert irods users. The learning curve of using iBridges is much easier than either of the two alternatives.
Additionally, its simplicity and default checks makes it less likely you will end up with bad data.

An advantage compared to the iCommands is that iBridges also works on Mac OS and Windows.
