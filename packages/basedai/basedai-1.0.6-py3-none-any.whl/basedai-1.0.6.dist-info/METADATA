BasedAI is a decentralized network built to enable end-to-end private computations on distributed GPU infrastructure. The flagship 'Brain' of BasedAI is allows for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) of Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively creating Zero-Knowledge LLMs (ZK-LLMs).

For detailed understanding of the BasedAI network and its groundbreaking approach with ZK-LLMs, please refer to our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01008).

# Install

1. To get started with BasedAI:

```bash
# pip install basedai
```

# Getting Started 

In the BasedAI ecosystem, users participate through an integrated wallet system that supports operations with BasedAI's native token, $BASED. The wallet enables users to stake tokens on different Brains in the ecosystem and earn rewards for contributions.

To get started with managing wallets and tokens:

1. Create a new wallet through the BasedAI CLI:
```bash
# create a wallet  
basedcli wallet new_personalkey
```

2. Interact with your wallet via the BasedAI CLI. 
```bash
# check the balances of your wallet 
basedcli wallet balance
```
3. Join as a Brain miner or validators with a compute key: 
```bash
# check the balances of your wallet 
basedcli wallet new_personalkey
```

```bash
# create a new compute wallet for agents operating on your behalf in the network
basedcli wallet new_computekey
```

2. Interact with your wallet via the BasedAI CLI. 
```bash
# check the balances of your wallet 
basedcli wallet balance
```

For further instructions on token management and participation in the network, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.getbased.ai/).

## Using the CLI

The BasedAI Command Line Interface (CLI) will be the primary tool for interacting with Brains, managing wallets, participating in computation tasks as miners or validators, and engaging in the token economy of BasedAI.

For a list of possible commands:
```bash
basedcli help
```

## The BasedAI PIP Package

The BasedAI package includes essential tools included `basedai` (the Python operations package for developers) and `basedcli` (for setting up mining, validation activities, and querying ZK-LLMs). Learn more in the [official documentation](https://docs.getbased.ai). 

## Governance and Voting

BasedAI embraces decentralized decision-making through Pepecoin-linked "Brains". Owners of GigaBrains, representing significant staked contributions, can participate in voting on key network decisions, upholding the ecosystem's democratic governance model.

For voting procedures:
```bash
# vote for a proposal
basedcli brains vote <proposal-id> <option>
```
