# DistFuse

DistFuse is a library to calculate similarity scores between two collections of text sequences encoded using transformer models. This library allows combining more than one models, including APIs from Cohere and OpenAI.

## Usage
We support `hf` (Hugging Face models), and APIs, such as `cohere`, and `openai`. For `dist_measure`, we support `cosine`, `euclidean`, and `manhattan`. If you are planning to use API models, please pass the appropriate token to `openai_token` or `cohere_token`. To use more than one model, add the model information to `model_checkpoints` and the weight to `weights`. There is no limit to the number of models you can use.

e.g., DistFuse with 2 models.
```python
from distfuse import DistFuse

model_checkpoints = [["sentence-transformers/LaBSE", "hf"], ["sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2", "hf"]]
weights = [1, 1]
dist_measure = "cosine" # cosine, euclidean, manhattan
model = DistFuse(model_checkpoints, weights, dist_measure, openai_token="", cohere_token="")

scores = model.score_pairs(["I like apple", "I like cats"], ["I like orange", "I like dogs"])
print(scores)
```

e.g., DistFuse with 3 models. 
```python
from distfuse import DistFuse

model_checkpoints = [["sentence-transformers/LaBSE", "hf"], ["sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2", "hf"], ["text-embedding-3-large", "openai"]]
weights = [1, 1, 1]
dist_measure = "cosine"
model = DistFuse(model_checkpoints, weights, dist_measure, openai_token="", cohere_token="")

scores = model.score_pairs(["I like apple", "I like cats"], ["I like orange", "I like dogs"])
print(scores)
```
