# Collective Mind interface and automation for ABTF

This repository contains [CM scripts (cross-platform automation recipes)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck)
to make it easier to prepare, train, evaluate and benchmark different versions of ABTF models 
(public or private) with Cognata dataset and MLPerf loadgen across different software and hardware.
