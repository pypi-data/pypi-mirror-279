**scikit-fallback** is a scikit-learn-compatible Python package for machine learning
with a reject option.

## Get started w/ `scikit-fallback`

### Usage
```python
from skfb.estimators import RateFallbackClassifierCV
from skfb.metrics import predict_reject_accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

rejector = RateFallbackClassifierCV(
    LogisticRegression(),
    fallback_rates=[0.05, 0.07],
    cv=5,
)
rejector.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = rejector.predict(X_test)
print(predict_reject_accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Installation
`scikit-fallback` requires:
* Python (>=3.9,< 3.13)
* scikit-learn (>=1.3)

### Examples

See the `examples/` directory for various applications of fallback estimators and
scorers to scikit-learn-compatible pipelines.
