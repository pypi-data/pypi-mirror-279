# This pyproject.toml is setup so it can be used with or without poetry and also
# supports editable installs (PEP 660) without breaking IDE and linter inspection.

# DEVELOPER INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (assuming current directory is at the top of the project) :
# Poetry:
#   poetry install --extras dev
# PIP:
#   pip install -e .[dev]

# everything in the boilerplate *SHOULD* match between the ScreenPyHQ packages.
