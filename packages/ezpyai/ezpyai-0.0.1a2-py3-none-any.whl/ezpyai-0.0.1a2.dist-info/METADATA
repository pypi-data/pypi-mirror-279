Hack the planet, one prompt at a time!

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Plug and play with OpenAI's API(and others in the future like LM Studio, Groq, HuggingFace, custom ones, etc). No need to sacrifice any goats.

## Usage

Here's a quick primer on how to use `ezpyai`. It's so simple, your pet hamster could do it (assuming it's a really smart hamster).

```python
from ezpyai.llm import OpenAI, Prompt

# Initialize the OpenAI client
ai_client = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Create a prompt
prompt = Prompt(user_message="Hello, world!")

# Get a response from the model
response = ai_client.get_response(prompt)
print(response)
```

See? Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
