OSL-ActionSpotting is a plug-and-play library that unifies action
spotting algorithms.

## ü•≥ What's New

- A technical report of this library will be provided soon.

## üìñ Major Features

- **Support SoTA TAD methods with modular design.** We decompose the TAD pipeline into different components, and implement them in a modular way. This design makes it easy to implement new methods and reproduce existing methods.
- **Support multiple datasets.** We support new datasets by giving a intermediate JSON format.
- **Support feature-based training and end-to-end training.** The feature-based training can easily be extended to end-to-end training with raw video input, and the video backbone can be easily replaced.
