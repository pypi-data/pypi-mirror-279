#Microcode Bit Optimization


    # Generate all possible combinations of bit assignments

    # Check each combination for correctness


    # Check if the given bit assignment is correct for all instructions

    # Check if the given instruction is correct with the given bit assignment
    # (Implementation of the correctness check depends on the specific microcode architecture and instruction set)

    # Placeholder implementation for demonstration purposes

# Example usage
