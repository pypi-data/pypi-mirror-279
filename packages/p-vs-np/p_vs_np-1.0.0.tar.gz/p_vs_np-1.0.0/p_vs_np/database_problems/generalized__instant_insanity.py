#Generalized  Instant Insanity

    # Solve the Instant Insanity puzzle

    # Base case: all cubes have been placed


    # Try all possible orientations for the current cube



    # Check if it is possible to place the cube in the current orientation

    # Check if any of the faces of the cube conflict with the previously placed cubes



    # Place the cube in the current orientation

    # Add the faces of the cube to the placed_faces list


    # Remove the cube from the placed_faces list

    # Remove the faces of the cube from the placed_faces list


# Example usage

# Initialize the placed_faces list
