#Disjoint Connecting Paths


    # Create a new graph with a supersource and a supersink

    # Connect source nodes to supersource and target nodes to supersink

    # Find maximum flow in the supergraph

    # Retrieve the disjoint connecting paths


# Example usage:

# Add edges to the graph

# Define source and target nodes

# Find disjoint connecting paths

# Print the paths
