# PDKMaster based GF180MCU PDK

This is pre-alpha development of PDKMaster based PDK for open source GF180MCU process.
Proper README still needs to be written.

# Versions

* [v0.0.7](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-gf2180mcu/-/commits/v0.0.7):
  * Improved module load time though lazy library creation
  * In exported klayout technology use layer properties from upstream

No release notes for v0.0.6 or older. It mimiced the development of the Sky130 and IHPSG13G2 development up to that but with only a standard cell library.
