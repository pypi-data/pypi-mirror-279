# FlyBrainLab Client

FlyBrainLab Client is a user-side backend implemented in Python that connects to the FFBO processor and accesses services provided by the connected backend servers. FlyBrainLab Client provides program execution APIs for handling requests to the server-side components and parsing of data coming from backend servers.

## Documentation

FlyBrainLab Client documentation is available at https://flybrainlab.github.io/FBLClient/.
