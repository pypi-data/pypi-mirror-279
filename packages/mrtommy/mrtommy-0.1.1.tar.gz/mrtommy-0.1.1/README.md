Tommy is a Python library that aims to speed up the development and experimentation of motion planning.
Among the goals of Tommy are:

-   Easy to work with (typing) and extend.
-   Easy to experiment with (matplotlib and notebook workflow).
-   Comparable performance.

Tommy was developed as part of the [Algorithmic Robotics and Motion Planning](https://www.cgl.cs.tau.ac.il/courses/algorithmic-robotics-and-motion-planning-fall-2023-2024/) course given in Tel Aviv University by Prof. Dan Halperin.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies with `pip install numpy networkx matplotlib tqdm pandas`, or use Rye.

Uncomment pieces of code inside the [main](src/mrtommy/__main__.py), add the necessary imports, then run `python3 -m mrtommy` from inside `src`.

## Acknowledgements

Mr. Tommy is **heavily** inspired by [discopygal](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~cgl/discopygal/docs/index.html), although it aims to provide a different experience.
