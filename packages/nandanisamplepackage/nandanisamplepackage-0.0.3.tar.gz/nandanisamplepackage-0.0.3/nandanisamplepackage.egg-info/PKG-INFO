### Example Code

You can also use the calculator functions in your Python code.

```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Perform addition
result = add(10, 5)
print(f"10 + 5 = {result}")

# Perform subtraction
result = subtract(10, 5)
print(f"10 - 5 = {result}")

# Perform multiplication
result = multiply(10, 5)
print(f"10 * 5 = {result}")

# Perform division
result = divide(10, 5)
print(f"10 / 5 = {result}")
