Repository for the code xARPES &ndash; extraction from angle resolved photoemission spectra.

This preliminary release can only be used to fit a Fermi edge. The complete functionality will be made available soon.

# Installation

xARPES can be installed with `pip`:

	python3 -m pip install xarpes

Or with `conda`:

	conda install conda-forge::xarpes

More detailed instructions for installing the development version, tested for recent Ubuntu and Debian GNU/Linux, are provided below.

## pip

It is highly recommended to set up a pristine Python virtual environment. First, the `venv` module might have to be installed:

	sudo apt install python3-venv

Afterwards, one can activate a virtual environment named `<my_venv>` using:

	python3 -m venv <my_venv>

It has to be activated whenever installing/running xARPES:

	source <my_venv>/bin/activate

It is recommended to upgrade `pip` to the latest version:

	python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

Finally, the installation can be performed:

	git clone git@github.com:xARPES/xARPES.git
	cd xARPES
	python3 -m pip install -e .

## conda

The user is assumed to be in a pristine virtual environment provided by conda. First, download the required version for your operating system from <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>. For example:

	wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Start the installation:

	bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Then scroll down the license agreement and answer `yes` to the following question:

	Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]

Also specify your installation location.

It is convenient to also answer `yes` to the following, which will append new lines to your `~/.bashrc`:

	You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]

A conda base environment is then activated with `source ~/.bashrc` or by starting a new terminal session.

Alternatively, you can answer `no` to the above question and activate conda whenever you need it:

	eval "$(<your_path>/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.<your_shell> hook)"

Next, we install `conda-build` for developing xARPES (answer `y` to questions):

	conda install conda-build

Finally, the following steps are executed for the installation &ndash; the `<my_env>` environment will have to be launched whenever running xARPES:

	git clone git@github.com:xARPES/xARPES.git
	cd xARPES
	conda create -n <my_env> -c defaults -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
	conda activate <my_env>
	conda develop .

Answer `y` to questions.

# Examples

Afer installation of xARPES, the `examples/` folder can be downloaded to the current directory with

    python3 -c "import xarpes; xarpes.download_examples()"

# Execution

It is recommended to use JupyterLab to analyse data. JupyterLab is launched using:

	jupyter lab
