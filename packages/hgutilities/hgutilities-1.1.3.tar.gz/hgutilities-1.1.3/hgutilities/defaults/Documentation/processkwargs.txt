Allows the user to easily set the key-words passed in to classes
as object attributes.

Calling "defaults.kwargs(self, **kwargs)" or
"defaults.kwargs(self, kwargs)" will take any key-word value pairs
in the kwargs dict and assign them as object variables. If these
key-words had default values set, they will be overruled by the new
values passed in.
