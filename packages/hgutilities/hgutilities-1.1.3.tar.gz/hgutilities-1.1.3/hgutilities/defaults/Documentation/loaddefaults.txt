Load

Takes key-word value pairs in a json file and sets them as
class attributes. The file will have the same name as the class
and should be located in a folder called "Default Settings" in
the same folder as the script where the class is defined.

After a class, (e.g. "MyClass") has been defined, calling
"Defaults.load(MyClass)" will load from the file if it exists.

Any keyword-value pairs defined in parent classes will be
inherited.
