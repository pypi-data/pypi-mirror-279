# Rocket Serializer

Rocket Serializer is a Python library that provides serialization capabilities
for OpenRocket files. It allows you to read OpenRocket files using a simple and
intuitive command line interface.

## Installation

You can install Rocket Serializer using pip:

```shell
pip install rocket-serializer
```

## Requirements

### Java

You need Java to be installed on your system to use Rocket Serializer.
We recommend downloading Java 17, which is required to run OpenRocket-23.09.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### OpenRocket

You also need to download the OpenRocket JAR file. You can download it from the
following link:

https://openrocket.info/downloads.html?vers=23.09#content-JAR

Each version of OpenRocket has its own jar file, and it is important to use the
correct java version to run the jar file.

### Python Packages

Once you download the package `rocket-serializer`, the following dependencies
will be automatically installed:

- bs4
- click
- lxml
- numpy
- orhelper
- pyyaml
- rocketpy
- nbformat

## Usage - command line interface

To use Rocket Serializer, you just need to use the cli option of the library.
Here's an example:

```bash
rocket-serializer ork2json --filepath path/to/input.ork --output path/to/output
```

The options are the following:

- `--filepath`: The .ork file to be serialized.
- `--output` : Path to the output folder. If not set, the output will be saved in the same folder os the filepath.
- `--eng` : Path to the engine file. If not set, the library will get the thrust curve from the OpenRocket file.
- `--ork_jar` : Specify the path to the OpenRocket jar file. If not set, the library will try to find the jar file in the current directory.
- `--verbose` : If you want to see the progress of the serialization, set this option to True. By default, it is set to False.

### Limitations

This code won't work for your rocket if it has any of the following features:

- Your file wasn't saved in English
- Your file doesn't contain simulation data
- Your rocket has more than one stage
- Your rocket has more than one engine
- Your rocket has more than one nosecone

### Deserialization

Still to be done.
