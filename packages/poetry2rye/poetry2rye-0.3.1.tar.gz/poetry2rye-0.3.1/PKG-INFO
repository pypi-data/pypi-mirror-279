# poetry2rye

A simple tool to migrate your Poetry project to rye.

# Install
```commandline
rye install poetry2rye
```

# Usage
### Migrate
`poetry2rye mig [PATH]`

Migrate path projects to rye.

This command does the following:
- if the project is flat-layout, make it src-layout
- remove poetry.lock
  - this doesn't respect the lock file (at this time)
- change pyproject.toml
  - remove `[tool.poetry]` and `[tool.poetry.*]`
  - make `[project]` from `[tool.poetry]` and `[tool.poetry.*]`
  - change `[build-system]`
  - add `[tool.rye]`
  - add `[tool.hatch.metadata]`

### Get Backup
`poetry2rye get-backup [PATH]`

Options:
- `-n [NUMBER]`: The number of the backup to retrieve. If not specified, the last backup created will be used.
- `-y`: Skip the confirmation prompt.

Retrieve the backup automatically created during migration and replace the project with the backup.

if NUMBER is not specified, the last backup created will be used.

The backup folder is `.__p2r_backup_{project_name}_{number}` format and placed in the same directory as the project directory (which is a child of the project parent directory).

# Other
This tool is for personal use and should be used at your own risk. Backups will be made, but we cannot be held responsible for project corruption!
