py_cfba
=============================

## Overview

`py_cfba` is a Python toolbox designed for constraint-based flux balance analysis of metabolic networks. This tool allows users to simulate metabolic networks by providing a stoichiometric matrix and other necessary parameters.

## Features

- Simulate metabolic networks using a stoichiometric matrix.
- Analyze imbalanced and balanced metabolites.
- Test enzyme capacities with known enzyme-reaction mappings and kcat values.
