"""A 2D ridig body physics engine to be used compatibly with any graphical library (pygame for now),
the main advantage to using this rather than others like pymunk or pybox2D is
that it has only the necessary features and not extra unnecessary ones,
this engine has been made with great concerns of performance for lower end systems
and easy to setup in a new or an existing game setup within 5 mins."""
