# RocketFlightSim

RocketFlightSim (RFS) is a light-weight flight simulator for experimental rockets. It is designed to be simple to use, understand, and modify, with the goal of providing a platform for students and hobbyists to learn about rocket flight dynamics.

The simulator currently supports simulation of single-stage rockets in the troposphere, from ignition to apogee. Simple airbrakes can added to the rocket to induce drag. 

A large emphasis is placed on computational efficiency, with the goal of being lightweight enough to run real-time during flight on an onboard microcontroller.
