<h1>Drug Response Evaluation of cancer cell line drug response models in a fair setting</h1><p>drevalpy is a Python package that provides a framework for evaluating cancer cell line drug response models in a fair setting. The package includes the functionality to load common drug response datasets and train pre-implemented models with hyperparamter tuning. It also contains robustness and randomization tests and functions to evaluate and visualize the results. The package is the basis for an associated Nextflow pipeline. </p>
