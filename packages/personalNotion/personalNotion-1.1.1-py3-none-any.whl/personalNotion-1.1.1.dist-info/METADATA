The base URL to send all API requests is https://api.notion.com. 

Both request and responses are encoded as JSON. 

SECRET KEY: API access require creating an "internal integration app" in python, which would produce a secret key, by which you can use to access its API services.

JSON conventions
    - "object": Type of top-level resource (e.g database, user)
    - "id": Specific top level resource
    - *Property names* -> This is in a_b format
    - *Temporial values* -> date time in ISO 8601 string format
    - Does not support empty strings (e.g. ""). Use null value instead. 


Top-level resources are addressable by a UUIDv4 "id" property. You may omit dashes from the ID when making requests to the API, e.g. when copying the ID from a Notion URL.
Property names are in snake_case (not camelCase or kebab-case).
Temporal values (dates and datetimes) are encoded in ISO 8601 strings. Datetimes will include the time value (2020-08-12T02:12:33.231Z) while dates will include only the date (2020-08-12)
The Notion API does not support empty strings. To unset a string value for properties like a url Property value object, for example, use an explicit null instead of "".
