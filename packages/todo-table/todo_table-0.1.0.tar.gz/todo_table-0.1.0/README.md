# todo-table

A dead-simple CLI for capturing basic to-dos built using [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) and [PrettyTable](https://github.com/jazzband/prettytable)

Disclaimer: this is something that I use personally, born out of my desire to experminent with some libraries I'm not too familiar with.  I will be adding a "roadmap" with some enhancements, but if others start using this I'd be happy to polish it up.
