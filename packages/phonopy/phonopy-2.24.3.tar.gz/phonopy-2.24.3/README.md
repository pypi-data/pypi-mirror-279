## Development

The development of phonopy is managed on the `develop` branch of github phonopy
repository.

- Github issues is the place to discuss about phonopy issues.
- Github pull request is the place to request merging source code.

### Formatting

Formatting rule is written in `pyproject.toml`.

### pre-commit

Pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/) is mainly used for applying the formatting
rule automatically. Therefore, the use is strongly encouraged at or before
git-commit. Pre-commit is set-up and used in the following way:

- Installed by `pip install pre-commit`, `conda install pre_commit` or see
  https://pre-commit.com/#install.
- pre-commit hook is installed by `pre-commit install`.
- pre-commit hook is run by `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Unless running pre-commit, pre-commit.ci may push the fix at PR by github
action. In this case, the fix should be merged by the contributor's repository.
### VSCode setting
- Not strictly, but VSCode's `settings.json` may be written like

  ```json
  "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
  "python.linting.flake8Args": ["--max-line-length=88", "--ignore=E203,W503"],
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
  "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
