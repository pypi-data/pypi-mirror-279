## Typing stubs for flake8

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`flake8`](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`flake8`.

This version of `types-flake8` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `flake8==7.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/flake8. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `340935b8b81e2eb19b9691683bc71f014707a033` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.367, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
