## Project status

This has been a side-project while at Torchbox and HarperCollins over the last four years. It has already been used successfully in production for both [public SaaS](https://app.wagtail.build) and internal applications.

I've recently been working on converting the code, which has been sitting on my Github account all this time, into something that can be used more widely. This involves a lot of API refinement, adding docs, building a demo, and a website.

I'm planning for a 0.1 final release in the summer of 2024.
