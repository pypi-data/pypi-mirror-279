class CoolingPowerDataFilter(DataFilter):
    """
    Calculate power absorbed by cooling liquid through a system given flow rate and input and output
    temperatures.

    The calculation requires each receipt of data to contain two temperature entries and one flow
    rate entry. For example:

    .. code-block:: none

        [
            {"type": "temperature", "id": "A_0", "value": 12.34, "units": "C"},
            {"type": "temperature", "id": "A_1", "value": 23.45, "units": "C"},
            {"type": "flow_rate", "id": "A_0", "value": 0.456, "units": "L/min"}
        ]
    
    The IDs used to select the appropriate temperatures and flow rate may be given in the
    initialisation parameters. Temperatures should be in celsius (or kelvin), and flow rate should
    be in litres per minute. By default, the heat capacity and density of water will be used for
    calculations, but alternate values may supplied as a parameters. Heat capacity should be in
    J/kg/K, and density in g/mL.

    If all required data entries are present, a new entry with a ``coolingpower`` type will be
    added, and the data will then look like:

    .. code-block:: none

        [
            {"type": "temperature", "id": "A_0", "value": 12.34, "units": "C"},
            {"type": "temperature", "id": "A_1", "value": 23.45, "units": "C"},
            {"type": "flow_rate", "id": "A_0", "value": 0.456, "units": "L/min"},
            {"type": "coolingpower", "id": "A_0", "value": 353.28, "units": "W"}
        ]
    
    The ID used for the ``coolingpower`` entry may also be specified as an initialisation parameter.
    If the flow rate entry includes a ``"timestamp"`` field, its value will be copied to the
    cooling power entry.

    :param heatcapacity: Heat capacity of cooling liquid, in J/kg/K.
