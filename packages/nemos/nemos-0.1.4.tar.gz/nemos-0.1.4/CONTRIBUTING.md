# Contributing

The NeMoS package is designed to provide a robust set of statistical analysis tools for neuroscience research. While the repository is managed by a core team of data scientists at the Center for Computational Neuroscience of the Flatiron Institute, we warmly welcome contributions from external collaborators.

## General Guidelines

Developers are encouraged to contribute to various areas of development. This could include the creation of concrete classes, such as those for new basis function types, or the addition of further checks at evaluation. Enhancements to documentation and the overall readability of the code are also greatly appreciated.

Feel free to work on any section of code that you believe you can improve. More importantly, remember to thoroughly test all your classes and functions, and to provide clear, detailed comments within your code. This not only aids others in using your library, but also facilitates future maintenance and further development.
