    The basic flow for a new organization is as follows: 1. View the available satellite targets with the [satellite targets](#tag/satellite-targets/get/v1/satellite-targets) endpoint. Copy the id of the target you want to observe. 2. Create an organization target with the [organization target](#tag/organization-targets/get/v1/organization-targets) endpoint. Use the id copied from above. 3. Create a webhook with the [webhook](#tag/webhooks/post/v1/communications/webhook) endpoint to receive TDMs automatically (preferred) or use the [tdms](#tag/tdms/get/v1/tdms) endpoint to poll for TDMs.
