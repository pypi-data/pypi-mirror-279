# Phi-3-Vision VLM Model for Apple MLX: An All-in-One Port

This project brings the powerful phi-3-vision VLM to Apple's MLX framework, offering a comprehensive solution for various text and image processing tasks. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this implementation offers a straightforward and minimalistic integration of the VLM model. It seamlessly incorporates essential functionalities such as generating quantized model weights, optimizing KV cache quantization during inference, facilitating LoRA/QLoRA training, and conducting model benchmarking, all encapsulated within a single file for convenient access and usage.

## Key Features

* **Batch Generation:** Accelerate inference by generating text for multiple prompts concurrently (107 tokens-per-sec batched vs 56 tokens-per-sec original)
* **Model Quantization:** Reduce model size for faster loading and deployment (2.3GB quantized vs 8.5GB original full-precision).
* **Cache Quantization:** Optimize inference for processing long contexts with key-value cache quantization.
* **Chat Template:** Utilize chat template for streamlining interactions with the model.
* **LoRA Training:** Easily customize the model for specific tasks or datasets using LoRA.
* **Benchmarking:** Quickly assess model performance on any dataset. (WIP)
* **Su-scaled RoPE:** Manages sequences of up to 128K tokens.
* **VLM Agent:** Leverages VLM's visual understanding for interactive code generation and refinement, enabling data visualization and image manipulation through a visual feedback loop. (WIP)
* **Long Context RAG:** Enables the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to harness large amounts of external knowledge for complex tasks such as code understanding, leveraging the phi-3-vision model's 128K context window. (WIP)

## Quick Start

### **Long Context RAG** (WIP)

This code demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow by fetching documentations and source codes from GitHub repositories, consolidating them into an 11,135 token prompt, and feeding it into a language model. Leveraging the 128K context window, the model then utilizes the retrieved information to provide an explanation of the codes contained in the target repository.

```python
# from phi_3_vision_mlx import _load_text

context = _load_text("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml-explore/mlx/main/docs/src", ["index.rst", "usage/quick_start.rst", "examples/mlp.rst", "examples/llama-inference.rst"])
gh_code = _load_text("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vegaluisjose/mlx-rag/main", ["model.py", "vdb.py",], True)
prompt = '{context}\n<|end|>\n<|user|>Explain the folowing codes.\n\n{gh_code}\n'.format(context=context, gh_code=gh_code)

The provided code is a Python implementation of a vector database (VDB) using the MLX framework. The VDB is designed to store and retrieve text data in a vectorized format, allowing for efficient similarity search and retrieval. The code includes several classes and functions to handle the various aspects of the VDB, such as loading and saving the model, ingesting text data, querying the database, and saving the database to disk.

The `Model` class is the main class that handles the vector database operations. It loads the model from a pre-trained embedding model and initializes the necessary components, such as the embeddings and the encoder. The `run` method is used to run the model on a given input text and returns the embeddings. The `savez` method is used to save the model to disk.

The `BertEmbeddings` class is a subclass of `nn.Module` that represents the BERT embeddings used for the VDB. It includes methods for initializing the embeddings and computing the embeddings for a given input text.

The `Bert` class is another subclass of `nn.Module` that represents the BERT model used for the VDB. It includes methods for running the model on a given input text and returning the embeddings.

The `Model` class is a wrapper class that uses the `Bert` class to create a vector database. It loads the model from a pre-trained embedding model and initializes the necessary components. The `ingest` method is used to ingest text data into the VDB. The `query` method is used to query the VDB for similar text based on a given input text.

The `VectorDB` class is a wrapper class that uses the `Model` class to create a vector database. It loads the model from a pre-trained embedding model and initializes the necessary components. The `ingest` method is used to ingest text data into the VDB. The `savez` method is used to save the VDB to disk.
